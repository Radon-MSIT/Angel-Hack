# PeaceOut

## Problem
The Code 4 Coexistence challenge will ask developers to find technology solutions to build tolerance-and foster understanding across cultures in order to preventing violent extremism. Developers may use any technology or platform, all we ask is that it focuses on inclusivity, peace and understanding and does not specifically target a group of individuals based on religion, gender, sexual orientation, or race.

## Idea
### The importance of the Religious Tourism Market

* Religious tourism is one of the earliest forms of tourism. The idea of the religious pilgrimage begins almost with the dawn of humanity.  Almost since the dawn of history human beings have traveled to holy sites.  By the Biblical period important religious centers had become not only a part of the cultural landscape, but they also had become major players in local marketing and important parts of the economy of those cities that hosted religious centers. 
* Religious tourism is not only a visitation to a particular holy destination, but may also be travel for a humanitarian cause, for reasons of friendship or even as a form of leisure.  Religious travel can be the primary reason for a trip but it can also be part of a trip and provide a destination with additional attractions.  A common mistake is assuming that a traveler must be of a particular religion in order to visit a specific religious site.
* For example, although the Vatican holds special meaning for followers of the Catholic faith, millions of non-Catholics also visit the Vatican both for its spirituality and for its architectural beauty.


## Solution
### A Chatbot

* It acts as a religious tourism guide to build mutual understanding across cultures in order to prevent violent extermism. We iterate positively to the knowledge of one's believe to another's culture. The religious and faith based market has the advantage of appealing to people from around the world, of all ages and of all nationalities.   
* The religious travel boom now also means it is easier for tourists to research their trips and find a vacation suited to their exact needs. Thus promote your faith based local companies. For example list locations where kosher food is available, where travelers can find Christian music and how travelers can visit local houses of worship, many of which are great places to see special works of art or to learn about the local culture.
